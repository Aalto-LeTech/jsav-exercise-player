How to configure the JSAV Exercise Player window with A+/Bootstrap modal?

Option 1
--------

<div id="jaalPlayerModal">:
  this is actually not needed

<div id="jaalModalContent">:
  This could have CSS:
  position: relative;
  top: -x;
  left: -y;

  Where `x` and `y` are the initial pixel coordinates of the top-left corner of
  the jaalModalContent <div> on the page. Is it possible to read them by
  jQuery and then alter them?

  Yes! $('#jaalModalContent').offset() (both get and set)

Another problem: CSS "position: fixed" is bad, because the modal is not
scrollable. We cannot assume that every user has at least 1280x1024 viewport!
